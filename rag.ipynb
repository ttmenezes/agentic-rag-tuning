To comprehensively address the original query, I need to form subqueries that will help retrieve information on each aspect separately. For battery technology, relevant subqueries could ask about Tesla's new battery chemistries, manufacturing techniques (like the 4680 cell), and advancements in battery management systems. For self-driving systems, subqueries should include questions about Tesla’s Autopilot features, hardware/software innovations, and development of AI chips. For the production and safety challenges portion, subqueries should investigate manufacturing hurdles (like scaling new batteries), reported safety issues with vehicles or autonomous features, and any regulatory scrutiny or recalls.\n",
